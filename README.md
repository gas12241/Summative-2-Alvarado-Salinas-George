Hello!

My Name is George and this is a project for the Netflix Pathways Bootcamp

In this project we went over APIs and how to use them with GraphQL.
There weren't a lot of things covered in this project, but that being said,
it still took a while to implement.

I want to touch on places I got help in, because this project would definitely
have been worse had I not had the help of some of my peers.

Some of the code in the controllers was modelled after a method that was given
to me by Suniul. I wasn't getting objects out of my calls while in graphql, so
I reached out to see what could have been the problem, and he told me that in
office hours, he was told to do it similar to what I have in my controllers,
where null is returned UNLESS the data that you are calling actually exists.

I also had A LOT of help from Ibrahim Awoleiro throughout this project. I started
off working on the Book and Publisher Models, Controllers, and Repositories, while
Ibrahim worked on everything related to the Author. That being said, I would not have
been able to finish without him. I wrote my own tests, but my Repo ones didn't work,
for a variety of reasons. He helped me out with that. He also helped me fix my GraphQL
queries as I had named them improperly (specifically the fields with two words like
firstName and postalCode). Lastly, he helped me understand how to create the One-to-Many
relationship in the models, and how to shape that up in the GraphQL types. Big thanks
to him.

That is all for my README. If you have any more questions, please reach out to me at
